# 🚀 BuilderMindAI — Launch Checklist
**Estimated human time: ~15 minutes (one-time only)**
After completing this, all future deploys are 100% autonomous.

---

## ✅ Already Done (by AI)
- [x] All 3 database migrations written (`migrations_no_rls.sql`)
- [x] Complete Next.js app built (auth, onboarding, AI estimator, Stripe, Vapi, PDF)
- [x] NEXTAUTH_SECRET generated
- [x] `.env.template` pre-filled with known values
- [x] `scripts/setup-stripe.js` — auto-creates Stripe products/prices/webhook
- [x] `scripts/setup.sh` — one-time credential wizard
- [x] `deploy.sh` — autonomous deploy (zero prompts, forever)
- [x] Vercel project linked (project.json exists)

## 🔴 Human Actions Required (15 min total)

### STEP 1 — Run Database Migration (3 min)
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qvoozieplmvripvbchvs/sql/new
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy entire content of `/a0/usr/workdir/migrations_no_rls.sql`
4. Paste and click **Run**
5. Should say "Success. No rows returned"

> **Eliminate forever:** Could automate with Supabase CLI + service role key.
> After setup.sh captures SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, future migrations run autonomously.

---

### STEP 2 — Run One-Time Setup Script (5 min)
```bash
cd /a0/usr/workdir/estimatorai
bash scripts/setup.sh
```
This will ask you to paste values from:
- **Supabase API keys:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qvoozieplmvripvbchvs/settings/api
  - `anon public` key
  - `service_role` key (secret)
- **OpenAI key:** https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- **Anthropic key:** https://console.anthropic.com/api-keys (optional)
- **Stripe keys:** https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
  - Secret key (`sk_live_...`)
  - Publishable key (`pk_live_...`)
- **Vercel token:** https://vercel.com/account/tokens → "Create Token" → Full Access

Script auto-runs `setup-stripe.js` to create products and fill in all price IDs.

> **Eliminate forever:** After this runs once, credentials are stored in .env
> All future actions (deploy, update, migrate) are 100% autonomous.

---

### STEP 3 — Deploy to Vercel (1 min)
```bash
cd /a0/usr/workdir/estimatorai
./deploy.sh
```
This pushes all env vars to Vercel and deploys to production automatically.

---

### STEP 4 — Point DNS to Vercel (5 min)
1. Log into Namecheap: https://namecheap.com
2. Go to **buildermindai.com** → Manage → Advanced DNS
3. Delete existing A records
4. Add these records:
   ```
   Type: A     Host: @    Value: 76.76.21.21   TTL: Auto
   Type: CNAME Host: www  Value: cname.vercel-dns.com  TTL: Auto
   ```
5. In Vercel dashboard → buildermindai.com project → Settings → Domains → Add `buildermindai.com`
6. DNS propagates in 5–30 minutes

> **Eliminate forever:** Namecheap has an API. After one-time API key capture,
> all future DNS changes can be made autonomously via script.
